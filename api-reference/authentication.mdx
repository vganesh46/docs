Each request to the API must be authenticated with a valid API key.

<Note>
  If you don't have an API key, please send your request via [API Access Request Form](https://airtable.com/appwmCiMxABL5dAtH/shrJoJJnvXDkbaXHf)
</Note>

## Access Control

API endpoints require authentication via the 'Authorization' header with a bearer token in the format 'Bearer <api_key>' for access. 

```json
'Authorization': 'Bearer <api_key>'
```
