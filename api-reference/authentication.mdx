Each request to the API must be authenticated with a valid API key.

### Getting your API key

Once you signup to your account, you can navigate to "API access" section under "Account Settings" to generate your API key.

### Access Control

API endpoints require authentication via the 'Authorization' header with a bearer token in the format 'Bearer <api_key>' for access. 

```json
'Authorization': 'Bearer <api_key>'
```
