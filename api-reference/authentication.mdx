## Welcome

Each request to the API must be authenticated with a valid API key.

<Note>
  If you don't have an API key, please send your request via [Contact Us](https://airtable.com/appOzDM0fPtHdHkdN/shrZ5uJRHuSqvwZdo)
</Note>

## Authentication

All API endpoints are authenticated using Authorization header and your dedicated API key. 

```json
'Authorization': 'Bearer <api_key>'
```
