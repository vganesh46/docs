## Welcome

Each request to the API must be authenticated with a valid API key.

### Getting your API key

Once you signup to your account, you can navigate to "API access" section under "Account Settings" to generate your API key.

### Access Control

All API endpoints are authenticated using Authorization header and your dedicated API key.

```json
'Authorization': 'Bearer <api_key>'
```
