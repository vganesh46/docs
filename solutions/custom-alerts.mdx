## Overview

Enhance your research and monitoring capabilities with our "Custom Alerts" feature. Create and manage personalized notifications based on your specific prompts.

## User Story: Automated Order Book Tracking

### The Challenge

An institutional investor needed efficient monitoring of portfolio developments without manual review of extensive filings. They sought automated notifications and summaries based on specific criteria.

### The Solution: Custom Alerts

We introduced "Custom Alerts," allowing investors to define criteria for tailored notifications and summaries.

### Key Capabilities

1. Define Criteria: Set alerts for specific events based on natural language prompts like "Notify when the CFO changes in any of my watchlist-A companies" or "Notify me when company-A makes any disclosure related to fund raise."
2. Receive Notifications: Instant email updates on defined triggers.
