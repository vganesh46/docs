## Overview

Imagine if every document you explore, every report you analyze, and every financial statement you encounter came with a knowledgeable assistant right by your side. This assistant can answer questions, retrieve information from specific sections, and even summarize complex details—all on demand. That’s precisely the power an Embeddable AI Agent brings to the table.

## What is an Embeddable AI Agent?

An embeddable AI agent is like a virtual research assistant you can integrate directly into your platform. Think of it as adding a well-trained assistant to your website or application, one that understands your data and can interact with users in real time, answering questions, offering insights, and even performing light analysis.

In StockInsights, our AI Agent can be embedded within your own website or mobile app through a simple code snippet, allowing you to deliver sophisticated financial intelligence directly to your users in a familiar chat interface.
